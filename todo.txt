  QA: 
  // - All hint errors
  // - FF error on Training level: got rid of undefined variable

  Sprint (Aesthetics):
    - Bug: Hidden buttons still interact
    - Bug: Sometimes word choices offer correct parts, but says it's wrong.
    - Refactor using Tween.js
    - highlight overlay button
    - Navigating causes level refresh (clicking World Level ON world level)

  Then show it off to people!
