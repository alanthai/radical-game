  Sprint (Aesthetics):
    //*- next 1 enemy
    // - Overlays + layouts
    //* - Temporary "Win!" screen
    //- Fancier text
    //* - Highlights events
    //* -- highlight overlay button
    // -- highlight level buttons (only highlights when level is reached)
    // - Fix positions and sizes of monsters; position of the lvl select buttons; Replace new background as test
    // - switched to newest version of PIXI.js

    - Bug: Hidden buttons still interact
    - Bug: Sometimes word choices offer correct parts, but says it's wrong.
    - Refactor using Tween.js
      -- Animations (death, and run away)

  Then show it off to people!
